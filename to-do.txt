TO DO:

-implement reconstructLine in all other functions

-replace all loops with scipy optimized iteration tools

- NaN handling

-better timeseries data capabilities
    -option to structure srcData dictionary by
        srcData[time][sens][meas] = value
    -this would require state attributes to determine which architecture the dict is in
    -then having all existing functions parse accordingly

-have header as an attribute rather than part of the dictionary

-consolidate chronological writing functions and convert to both dict arch's
